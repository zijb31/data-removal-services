**How long does it take for a data removal service to work?**
You'll typically start seeing results within the first couple of weeks, but it can take a month or two for the most stubborn removals. The services work continuously to keep you protected.

**Can I just remove my data from these sites myself?**
Yes, you can, but it is an incredibly tedious and ongoing process. Each site has its own convoluted opt-out procedure, and your data often reappears, requiring you to do it all over again.

**Will my info disappear from Google after using these services?**
These services remove your profile from the source website (the data broker). Once that page is deleted, it will no longer be discoverable and will eventually fall out of Google's search results.
